# PythonArduinoExamples
Example code for using arduino and python... TOGETHER :D\
A lot of projects I have worked on require two types of computing devices \
One is effectively a full desktop computer (os/drivers/multiprossing/easy internet access/ lots of memory)
that can run a scripted language (python/bash/perl)\
While the other system runs a single program that manages a bunch of GPIO's and interacts with hardware through IC2/SPI/Serial (Arduino!)\
This entails connecting and communicating between these to programs. This repository contains example files on  how to do that!\
Enjoy, feed back is always welcome!
